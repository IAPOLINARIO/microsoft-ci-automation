.SYNOPSIS 
   Performs the installation of the Chocolatey
.DESCRIPTION 
    Chocolatey is a single, unified interface designed to easily work with all aspects of managing Windows software 
    using a packaging framework that understands both versioning and dependency requirements. Chocolatey packages 
    encapsulate everything required to manage a particular piece of software into one deployment artifact by wrapping 
    installers, executables, zips, and scripts into a compiled package file.
